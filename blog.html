        <h2>The Role of Nutrition in Maintaining Good Health</h2>
        <p>Nutrition plays a fundamental role in supporting overall health and well-being. The food we consume provides essential nutrients that are vital for various bodily functions, including energy production, immune system function, and tissue repair.</p>
        <p>A balanced and nutritious diet includes a variety of foods that supply the body with essential vitamins, minerals, proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. These nutrients contribute to the maintenance of healthy organs, bones, muscles, and skin.</p>
        <p>Moreover, proper nutrition is key to preventing and managing chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.
